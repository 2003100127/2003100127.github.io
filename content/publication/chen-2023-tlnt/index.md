abstract: While several artificial nanodrugs have been approved for clinical treatment
  of breast tumor, their long-term applications are restricted by unsatisfactory therapeutic
  outcomes, side reactions and high costs. Conversely, edible plant-derived natural
  nanotherapeutics (NTs) are source-widespread and cost-effective, which have been
  shown remarkably effective in disease treatment. Herein, we extracted and purified
  exosome-like NTs from tea leaves (TLNTs), which had an average diameter of 166.9 nm
  and a negative-charged surface of − 28.8 mV. These TLNTs contained an adequate slew
  of functional components such as lipids, proteins and pharmacologically active molecules.
  In vitro studies indicated that TLNTs were effectively internalized by breast tumor
  cells (4T1 cells) and caused a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of intracellular
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) after incubation for 8 h. The high levels of ROS triggered
  mitochondrial damages and arrested cell cycles, resulting in the apoptosis of tumor
  cells. The mouse experiments revealed that TLNTs achieved good therapeutic effects
  against breast tumors regardless of intravenous injection and oral administration
  through direct pro-apoptosis and microbiota modulation. Strikingly, the intravenous
  injection of TLNTs, not oral administration, yielded obvious hepatorenal toxicity
  and immune activation. These findings collectively demonstrate that TLNTs can be
  developed as a promising oral therapeutic platform for the treatment of breast cancer.
