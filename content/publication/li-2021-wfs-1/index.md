abstract: Objective. Genetic variants in the WFS1 gene can cause Wolfram syndrome
  (WS) or autosomal dominant nonsyndromic low-frequency hearing loss (HL). This study
  is aimed at investigating the molecular basis of HL in an affected Chinese family
  and the genotype-phenotype correlation of WFS1 variants. Methods. The clinical phenotype
  of the five-generation Chinese family was characterized using audiological examinations
  and pedigree analysis. Target exome sequencing of 129 known deafness genes and bioinformatics
  analysis were performed among six patients and four normal subjects to screen suspected
  pathogenic variants. We built a complete WFS1 protein model to assess the potential
  effects of the variant on protein structure. Results. A novel heterozygous pathogenic
  variant NM_006005.3 c.2020G>T (p.Gly674Trp) was identified in the WFS1 gene, located
  in the C-terminal domain of the wolframin protein. We further showed that HL-related
  WFS1 missense variants were mainly concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  domain. In contrast, WS-related missense variants are randomly distributed throughout
  the protein. Conclusions. In this family, we identified a novel variant p.Gly674Trp
  of WFS1 as the primary pathogenic variant causing the low-frequency sensorineural
  HL, enriching the mutational spectrum of the WFS1 gene.
