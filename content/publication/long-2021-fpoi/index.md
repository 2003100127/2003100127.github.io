abstract: Summary Genetic hybridization of exogenous functional protein(s) of interest
  (POI) with silk using transgenic silkworms provides promising bio-synthesis platforms
  to design silk-based materials. To ensure successful hybridization, additive domains
  from natural silk are routinely fused with POI to form fusion POI (F-POI), but they
  often lead to superfluous post-translational modifications, compromise normal folding,
  and severely impair the activity of POI. Here, “light-clothing” strategy, i.e.,
  rationally trimming redundant parts of additive domains, is proposed. As visualized
  by green fluorescent protein as marker POI, this strategy avoids supernumerary post-translational
  modifications in F-POI synthesis, and enables its normal secretion and extraction.
  Applying epidermal growth factor as model functional POI, material fabrication versatility
  of the extracted mixture of F-POI and silk is demonstrated. This strategy increases
  structural similarity between F-POI and native POI and remarkably enhances F-POI
  activity to the same level as commercial POI, which facilitates applications of
  these advanced bio-synthesis platforms for developing high-performance materials.
