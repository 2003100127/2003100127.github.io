abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) with its rapidly increasing incidence has become
  an emerging challenge for public health. Therapeutic agents are required to be specifically
  delivered to colon epithelial cells and macrophages with controlled release in the
  cytoplasm for wound healing, inflammation alleviation, and microbiota rebalance.
  As a promising biomaterial for accomplishing this, Antheraea pernyi silk fibroin
  (ApSF) was selected and engineered to form nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with the anti-inflammatory
  drug, resveratrol (Res). The intrinsic features of these fabricated Res-ApNPs included
  targeting of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages, lysosomal escape capacity,
  and responsiveness to pH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione, which
  were pertinent to their functional units such as arginine-glycine-aspartate tripeptides,
  α-helixes, β-sheets, and disulfide bonds, enabling on-demand release of Res molecules
  in the cytoplasm of target cells. The Res-ApNP treatment restored damaged colonic
  epithelial barriers, polarized macrophages to type M2, alleviated inflammatory reactions,
  and reduced the level of intracellular ROS. Oral treatment with chitosan-alginate
  hydrogels embedded with Res-ApNPs substantially relieved UC symptoms, as evidenced
  by decreased colonic inflammation, increased synthesis of tight-junction proteins,
  and rebalanced intestinal microbiota. Our findings suggest that these high-performance
  ApSF-based NPs can be developed as effective drug carriers for oral UC treatment.
