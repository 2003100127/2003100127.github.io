abstract: Abstract The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis
  (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and
  subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, high-performance pluronic
  F127 (P127)-modified gold shell (AuS)-polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with
  curcumin (CUR) is constructed. Under near-infrared irradiation, the resultant P127-AuS@CURs
  generate transient mild photothermia (TMP; ≈42 °C, 10 min), which facilitates their
  penetration through colonic mucus and favors multiple cellular processes, including
  cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy
  relieves intracellular oxidative stress, improves wound healing, and reduces immune
  responses by polarizing the proinflammatory M1-type macrophages to the anti-inflammatory
  M2-type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel-encapsulating P127-AuS@CURs plus intestinal
  intralumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated
  to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment
  of P127-AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevates the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g.,
  Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites can also mitigate colitis
  symptoms by regulating genes associated with antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and
  wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intralumen TMP offers a promising approach
  to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.
