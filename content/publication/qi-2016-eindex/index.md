abstract: While it is a daunting challenge in current biology to understand how the
  underlying network of genes regulates complex dynamic traits, functional mapping,
  a tool for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs), has been applied in a variety of cases to tackle this challenge. Though
  useful and powerful, functional mapping performs well only when one or more model
  parameters are clearly responsible for the developmental trajectory, typically being
  a logistic curve. Moreover, it does not work when the curves are more complex than
  that, especially when they are not monotonic. To overcome this inadaptability, we
  therefore propose a mathematical-biological concept and measurement, E-index (earliness-index),
  which cumulatively measures the earliness degree to which a variable (or a dynamic
  trait) increases or decreases its value. Theoretical proofs and simulation studies
  show that E-index is more general than functional mapping and can be applied to
  any complex dynamic traits, including those with logistic curves and those with
  nonmonotonic curves. Meanwhile, E-index vector is proposed as well to capture more
  subtle differences of developmental patterns.
