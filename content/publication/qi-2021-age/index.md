abstract: <p>Early cancer detection is the key to a positive clinical outcome. While
  a number of early diagnostics methods exist in clinics today, they tend to be invasive
  and limited to a few cancer types. Thus, a clear need exists for non-invasive diagnostics
  methods that can be used to detect the presence of cancer of any type. Liquid biopsy
  based on analysis of molecular components of peripheral blood has shown significant
  promise in such pan-cancer diagnostics; however, existing methods based on this
  approach require improvements, especially in sensitivity of early-stage cancer detection.
  The improvement would likely require diagnostics assays based on multiple different
  types of biomarkers and, thus, calls for identification of novel types of cancer-related
  biomarkers that can be used in liquid biopsy. Whole-blood transcriptome, especially
  its non-coding component, represents an obvious yet under-explored biomarker for
  pan-cancer detection. In this study, we show that whole transcriptome analysis using
  RNA-seq could indeed serve as a viable biomarker for pan-cancer detection. Furthermore,
  a class of long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, very long intergenic non-coding (vlinc) RNAs,
  demonstrated superior performance compared with protein-coding mRNAs. Finally, we
  show that age and presence of non-blood cancers change transcriptome in similar,
  yet not identical, directions and explore implications of this observation for pan-cancer
  diagnostics.</p>
