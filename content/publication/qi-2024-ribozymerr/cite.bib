 abstract = {Accurate identification of the correct, biologically relevant RNA structures is critical to understanding various aspects of RNA biology since proper folding represents the key to functionality of all types of RNA molecules and plays pivotal roles in many essential biological processes. Thus, a plethora of approaches have been developed to predict, identify, or solve RNA structures based on various computational, molecular, genetic, chemical, or physicochemical strategies. Purely computational approaches hold distinct advantages over all other strategies in terms of the ease of implementation, time, speed, cost, and throughput, but they strongly underperform in terms of accuracy that significantly limits their application. Nonetheless, the advantages of these methods led to a steady development of multiple in silico RNA secondary structure prediction approaches including recent deep learning-based programs. Here, we compared the accuracy of predictions of biologically relevant secondary structures of dozens of self-cleaving ribozyme sequences using 7 in silico RNA folding prediction tools with tasks of varying complexity. We found that while many programs performed well in relatively simple tasks, the performance varied significantly in more complex RNA folding problems. However, in general, a modern deep learning method outperformed the other programs in the complex tasks in predicting the RNA secondary structures, at least based on the specific class of tested sequences, suggesting that it might represent the future of RNA structure prediction algorithms.},
