abstract: Hydrocarbon pollution poses substantial environmental risks to water and
  soil. Bioremediation, which utilizes microorganisms to manage pollutants, offers
  a cost-effective solution. However, the role of viruses, particularly bacteriophages
  (phages), in bioremediation remains unexplored. This study examines the diversity
  and activity of hydrocarbon-degradation genes encoded by environmental viruses,
  focusing on phages, within public databases. We identified 57 high-quality phage-encoded
  auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) related to hydrocarbon degradation, which we refer
  to as virus-encoded hydrocarbon degradation genes (vHYDEGs). These genes are encoded
  by taxonomically diverse aquatic phages and highlight the under-characterized global
  virosphere. Six protein families involved in the initial alkane hydroxylation steps
  were identified. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the diverse evolutionary trajectories
  of vHYDEGs across habitats, revealing previously unknown biodegraders linked evolutionarily
  with vHYDEGs. Our findings suggest phage AMGs may contribute to alkane and aromatic
  hydrocarbon degradation, participating in the initial, rate-limiting hydroxylation
  steps, thereby aiding hydrocarbon pollution bioremediation and promoting their propagation.
  To support future research, we developed vHyDeg, a database containing identified
  vHYDEGs with comprehensive annotations, facilitating the screening of hydrocarbon
  degradation AMGs and encouraging their bioremediation applications.
