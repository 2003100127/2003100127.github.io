abstract: Small molecules have been providing medical breakthroughs for human diseases
  for more than a century. Recently, identifying small molecule inhibitors that target
  microRNAs (miRNAs) has gained importance, despite the challenges posed by labour-intensive
  screening experiments and the significant efforts required for medicinal chemistry
  optimization. Numerous experimentally-verified cases have demonstrated the potential
  of miRNA-targeted small molecule inhibitors for disease treatment. This new approach
  is grounded in their posttranscriptional regulation of the expression of disease-associated
  genes. Reversing dysregulated gene expression using this mechanism may help control
  dysfunctional pathways. Furthermore, the ongoing improvement of algorithms has allowed
  for the integration of computational strategies built on top of laboratory-based
  data, facilitating a more precise and rational design and discovery of lead compounds.
  To complement the use of extensive pharmacogenomics data in prioritising potential
  drugs, our previous work introduced a computational approach based on only molecular
  sequences. Moreover, various computational tools for predicting molecular interactions
  in biological networks using similarity-based inference techniques have been accumulated
  in established studies. However, there are a limited number of comprehensive reviews
  covering both computational and experimental drug discovery processes. In this review,
  we outline a cohesive overview of both biological and computational applications
  in miRNA-targeted drug discovery, along with their disease implications and clinical
  significance. Finally, utilising drug-target interaction (DTIs) data from DrugBank,
  we showcase the effectiveness of deep learning for obtaining the physicochemical
  characterization of DTIs.
