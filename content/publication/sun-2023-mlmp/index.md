abstract: Membrane proteins mediate a wide spectrum of biological processes, such
  as signal transduction and cell communication. Due to the arduous and costly nature
  inherent to the experimental process, membrane proteins have long been devoid of
  well-resolved atomic-level tertiary structures and, consequently, the understanding
  of their functional roles underlying a multitude of life activities has been hampered.
  Currently, computational tools dedicated to furthering the structure-function understanding
  are primarily focused on utilizing intelligent algorithms to address a variety of
  site-wise prediction problems (e.g., topology and interaction sites), but are scattered
  across different computing sources. Moreover, the recent advent of deep learning
  techniques has immensely expedited the development of computational tools for membrane
  protein-related prediction problems. Given the growing number of applications optimized
  particularly by manifold deep neural networks, we herein provide a review on the
  current status of computational strategies mainly in membrane protein type classification,
  topology identification, interaction site detection, and pathogenic effect prediction.
  Meanwhile, we provide an overview of how the entire prediction process proceeds,
  including database collection, data pre-processing, feature extraction, and method
  selection. This review is expected to be useful for developing more extendable computational
  tools specific to membrane proteins.
