abstract: Transmembrane proteins are receptors, enzymes, transporters and ion channels
  that are instrumental in regulating a variety of cellular activities, such as signal
  transduction and cell communication. Despite tremendous progress in computational
  capacities to support protein research, there is still a significant gap in the
  availability of specialized computational analysis toolkits for transmembrane protein
  research. Here, we introduce TMKit, an open-source Python programming interface
  that is modular, scalable and specifically designed for processing transmembrane
  protein data. TMKit is a one-stop computational analysis tool for transmembrane
  proteins, enabling users to perform database wrangling, engineer features at the
  mutational, domain and topological levels, and visualize proteinâ€“protein interaction
  interfaces. In addition, TMKit includes seqNetRR, a high-performance computing library
  that allows customized construction of a large number of residue connections. This
  library is particularly well suited for assigning correlation matrix-based features
  at a fast speed. TMKit should serve as a useful tool for researchers in assisting
  the study of transmembrane protein sequences and structures. TMKit is publicly available
  through https://github.com/2003100127/tmkit and https://tmkit-guide.herokuapp.com/doc/overview.
