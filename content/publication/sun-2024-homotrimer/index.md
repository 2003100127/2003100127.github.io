abstract: Unique molecular identifiers are random oligonucleotide sequences that remove
  PCR amplification biases. However, the impact that PCR associated sequencing errors
  have on the accuracy of generating absolute counts of RNA molecules is underappreciated.
  We show that PCR errors are a source of inaccuracy in both bulk and single-cell
  sequencing data, and synthesizing unique molecular identifiers using homotrimeric
  nucleotide blocks provides an error-correcting solution that allows absolute counting
  of sequenced molecules.
