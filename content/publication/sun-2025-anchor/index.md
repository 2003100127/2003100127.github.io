abstract: <p>Single-cell transcriptomics, which utilises barcodes and unique molecular
  identifiers (UMIs) for polyA+ mRNA capture, is compromised by oligonucleotide synthesis
  errors. To address this, we modified the oligonucleotide capture design and integrated
  an interposed anchor between the barcode and the UMI. This design significantly
  reduces the need to discard reads due to synthesis inaccuracies. Our results demonstrate
  that this anchor-enhanced design substantially improves gene expression profiles
  in droplet-based single-cell sequencing analyses.</p>
