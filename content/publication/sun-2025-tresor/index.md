abstract: The rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies has spurred
  the development of numerous computational tools designed to identify gene expression
  patterns from growing datasets at both bulk and single-cell sequencing levels. The
  recent advent of longread sequencing technologies has further accelerated the availability
  and refinement of these tools. The lack of ground-truth labels and annotations in
  sequencing data presents a significant challenge for evaluating the efficacy of
  analytical tools. To address this, we developed Tresor, an integrated platform for
  simulating both short and long reads at bulk and single-cell levels. We devised
  a tree-based algorithm to significantly accelerate in silico experiments at high
  PCR cycles. Tresor allows for customising sequencing libraries with highly modular
  and flexible read structures, facilitating the verification of sequencing-related
  biological discoveries. This tool also includes features that introduce substitution,
  insertion, and deletion errors at various stages of library preparation, PCR amplification,
  and sequencing, enhancing its applicability in diverse experimental conditions and
  simulating real world conditions. Our results demonstrate that, upon removal of
  PCR duplicates, cell type-specific gene expression profiles derived from our simulated
  reads highly resemble reference data. We envisage that Tresor will provide valuable
  insights into a broader range of transcriptomics analyses and support the development
  of more effective algorithms for read alignment and UMI deduplication.Competing
