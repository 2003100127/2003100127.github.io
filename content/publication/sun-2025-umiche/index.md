abstract: Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) have actively been utilised by various
  RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) protocols and technologies to remove polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR) duplicates, thus enhancing counting accuracy. However, errors during sequencing
  processes often compromise the precision of UMI-assisted quantification. To overcome
  this, various computational methods have been proposed for UMI error correction.
  Despite these advancements, the absence of a unified benchmarking and validation
  framework for UMI deduplication methods hinders the systematic evaluation and optimisation
  of these methods. Here, we present UMIche, an open-source, UMI-centric computational
  platform designed to improve molecular quantification by providing a systematic,
  integrative, and extensible framework for UMI analysis. Additionally, it supports
  the development of more effective UMI deduplication strategies. We show that through
  its integration of a broad spectrum of UMI deduplication methods and computational
  workflows, UMIche significantly advances the accuracy of molecular quantification
  and facilitates the generation of high-fidelity gene expression profiles.Competing
