abstract: Duck hepatitis A virus genotype 3 (DHAV-3) is the most popular pathogen
  of duck viral hepatitis (DVH) and has led to a huge economic threat to the Asian
  duck industry. In this work, we investigated the differences in the LC-MS/MS-based
  dynamic lipid profiles between susceptible and resistant Pekin duck lines with DHAV-3
  infection. We found that the plasma lipidome of the two duck lines was characterized
  differently in expression levels of lipids during the infection, such as decreased
  levels of glycerolipids and increased levels of cholesteryl esters and glycerophospholipids
  in susceptible ducks compared with resistant ducks. By integrating lipidomics and
  transcriptomics analysis, we showed that the altered homeostasis of lipids was potentially
  regulated by a variety of differentially expressed genes including CHPT1, PI4K2A,
  and OSBP2 between the two duck lines, which could account for liver dysfunction,
  apoptosis, and illness upon DHAV-3 infection. Using the least absolute shrinkage
  and selection operator (LASSO) approach, we determined a total of 25 infection-related
  lipids that were able to distinguish between the infection states of susceptible
  and resistant ducks. This study provides molecular clues for elucidating the pathogenesis
  and therapeutic strategies of DHAV-3 infection in ducklings, which has implication
  for the development of resistance breeding.
