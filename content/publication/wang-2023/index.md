abstract: Abstract Polyacrylic acid (PAA) and its derivatives are commonly used as
  essential matrices in wound dressings, but their weak wet adhesion restricts the
  clinical application. To address this issue, a PAA-based coacervate hydrogel with
  strong wet adhesion capability is fabricated through a facile mixture of PAA copolymers
  with isoprenyl oxy poly(ethylene glycol) ether and tannic acid (TA). The poly(ethylene
  glycol) segments on PAA prevent the electrostatic repulsion among the ionized carboxyl
  groups and absorbed TA to form coacervates. The absorbed TA provides solid adhesion
  to dry and wet substrates via multifarious interactions, which endows the coacervate
  with an adhesive strength to skin of 23.4 kPa and 70% adhesion underwater. This
  coacervate achieves desirable self-healing and extensible properties suitable for
  frequently moving joints. These investigations prove that the coacervate has strong
  antibacterial activity, facilitatesÂ fibroblast migration, and modulates M1/M2 polarization
  of macrophages. In vivo hemorrhage experiments further confirm that the coacervate
  dramatically shortens the hemostatic time from hundreds to tens of seconds. In addition,
  full-thickness skin defect experiments demonstrate that the coacervate achieves
  the best therapeutic effect by significantly promoting collagen deposition, angiogenesis,
  and epithelialization. These results demonstrate that a PAA-based coacervate hydrogel
  is a promising wound dressing for medical translation.
