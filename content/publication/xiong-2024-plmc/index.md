abstract: X-ray diffraction crystallography has been most widely used for protein
  three-dimensional (3D) structure determination for which whether proteins are crystallizable
  is a central prerequisite. Yet, there are a number of procedures during protein
  crystallization, including protein material production, purification, and crystal
  production, which take turns affecting the crystallization outcome. Due to the expensive
  and laborious nature of this multi-stage process, various computational tools have
  been developed to predict protein crystallization propensity, which is then used
  to guide the experimental determination. In this study, we presented a novel deep
  learning framework, PLMC, to improve multi-stage protein crystallization propensity
  prediction by leveraging a pre-trained protein language model. To effectively train
  PLMC, two groups of features of each protein were integrated into a more comprehensive
  representation, including protein language embeddings from the large-scale protein
  sequence database and a handcrafted feature set consisting of physicochemical, sequence-based
  and disordered-related information. These features were further separately embedded
  for refinement, and then concatenated for the final prediction. Notably, our extensive
  benchmarking tests demonstrate that PLMC greatly outperforms other state-of-the-art
  methods by achieving AUC scores of 0.773, 0.893, and 0.913, respectively, at the
  aforementioned individual stages, and 0.982 at the final crystallization stage.
  Furthermore, PLMC is shown to be superior for predicting the crystallization of
  both globular and membrane proteins, as demonstrated by an AUC score of 0.991 for
  the latter. These results suggest the significant potential of PLMC in assisting
  researchers with the experimental design of crystallizable protein variants.
