   abstract = {Accurate prediction of amino acid residue contacts is an important prerequisite for generating high-quality 3D models of transmembrane (TM) proteins. While a large number of compositional, evolutionary, and structural properties of proteins can be used to train contact prediction methods, recent research suggests that coevolution between residues provides the strongest indication of their spatial proximity. We have developed a deep learning approach, DeepHelicon, to predict inter-helical residue contacts in TM proteins by considering only coevolutionary features. DeepHelicon comprises a two-stage supervised learning process by residual neural networks for a gradual refinement of contact maps, followed by variance reduction by an ensemble of models. We present a benchmark study of 12 contact predictors and conclude that DeepHelicon together with the two other state-of-the-art methods DeepMetaPSICOV and Membrain2 outperforms the 10 remaining algorithms on all datasets and at all settings. On a set of 44 TM proteins with an average length of 388 residues DeepHelicon achieves the best performance among all benchmarked methods in predicting the top L/5 and L/2 inter-helical contacts, with the mean precision of 87.42% and 77.84%, respectively. On a set of 57 relatively small TM proteins with an average length of 298 residues DeepHelicon ranks second best after DeepMetaPSICOV. DeepHelicon produces the most accurate predictions for large proteins with more than 10 transmembrane helices. Coevolutionary features alone allow to predict inter-helical residue contacts with an accuracy sufficient for generating acceptable 3D models for up to 30% of proteins using a fully automated modeling method such as CONFOLD2.},

   abstract = {Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in a variety of pathological processes by interacting with their specific target mRNAs for translation repression and may function as oncogenes (oncomiRs) or tumor suppressors (TSmiRs). Therefore, a web server that could predict the regulation relations between miRNAs and small molecules is expected to achieve implications for identifying potential therapeutic targets for anti-tumor drug development.Methods: Upon obtaining positive/known small molecule-miRNA regulation pairs from SM2miR, we generated a multitude of high-quality negative/unknown pairs by leveraging similarities between the small molecule structures. Using the pool of the positive and negative pairs, we created the Dataset1 and Dataset2 datasets specific to up-regulation and down-regulation pairs, respectively. Manifold machine learning algorithms were then employed to construct models of predicting up-regulation and down-regulation pairs on the training portion of pairs in Dataset1 and Dataset2, respectively. Prediction abilities of the resulting models were further examined by discovering potential small molecules to regulate oncogenic miRNAs identified from miRNA sequencing data of endometrial carcinoma samples.Results: The random forest algorithm outperformed four machine-learning algorithms by achieving the highest AUC values of 0.911 for the up-regulation model and 0.896 for the down-regulation model on the testing datasets. Moreover, the down-regulation and up-regulation models yielded the accuracy values of 0.91 and 0.90 on independent validation pairs, respectively. In a case study, our model showed highly-reliable results by confirming all top 10 predicted regulation pairs as experimentally validated pairs. Finally, our predicted binding affinities of oncogenic miRNAs and small molecules bore a close resemblance to the lowest binding energy profiles using molecular docking.

It exploits a dual-reference strategy to engineer a curated set of genomic, alignment, and genotyping features based on a reference genome in concert with an allele-based alternative genome.

On two additional sets of 121,435 cattle SVs and 113,042 sheep SVs, SVLearn demonstrates a strong generalizability to cross-species genotype SVs with a weighted genotype concordance score of up to 90%.

To date, no computational tools have been dedicated to predicting small molecule-mediated upregulation or downregulation of lncRNA expression. Here, we introduce DeepdlncUD, which integrates predictions of nine deep learning algorithms together, to infer the regulation types of small molecules on modulating lncRNA expression. Through systematic optimization on a training set of 771 upregulation and 739 downregulation SM-lncR pairs, each encoding 1369 sequence, representational, and physiochemical features, this method outperforms a recently released program, DeepsmirUD, by achieving 0.674 in AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), 0.722 in AUCPR (area under the precision-recall curve), 0.681 in F1-score, and 0.516 in Jaccard Index on a test set of 222 SM-lncR pairs. By extracting 125 upregulation and 46 downregulation SM-lncR pairs that involve disease-associated lncRNAs, DeepdlncUD is shown to gain an accuracy of 0.700 in the pathological context. Using connectivity scores, around half of the small molecules are correctly estimated as drugs to treat lncRNA-regulated diseases.

This new approach is grounded in their posttranscriptional regulation of the expression of disease-associated genes. Reversing dysregulated gene expression using this mechanism may help control dysfunctional pathways.

Herein, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/ultrasound (US)-driven mesoporous manganese oxide (MnOx)-based nanomotors are constructed by loading mitochondrial sonosensitizers into their mesoporous channels and orderly dual-functionalizing their surface with silk fibroin and chondroitin sulfate. The locomotory activities and tumor-targeting capacities of the resultant nanomotors (CS-ID@NMs) are greatly improved in the presence of H2O2 and US irradiation, inducing efficient mucus-traversing and deep tumor penetration. The excess H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is decomposed into hydroxyl radicals and oxygen by an Mn2+-mediated Fenton-like reaction, and the produced oxygen participates in sonodynamic therapy (SDT), yielding abundant singlet oxygen. The combined Mn2+-mediated chemodynamic therapy and SDT cause effective ferropotosis of tumor cells and accelerate the release of tumor antigens. Importantly, animal experiments reveal that the treatment of combining oral hydrogel (chitosan/alginate)-embedding CS-ID@NMs and immune checkpoint inhibitors can simultaneously suppress the growth of primary and distal tumors through direct killing, reversion of immunosuppressive TME, and potentiation of systemic anti-tumor immunity, demonstrating that the CS-ID@NM-based platform is a robust oral system for synergistic treatment of colon cancer.},

Genetic hybridization of exogenous functional protein(s) of interest (POI) with silk using transgenic silkworms provides promising bio-synthesis platforms to design silk-based materials. To ensure successful hybridization, additive domains from natural silk are routinely fused with POI to form fusion POI (F-POI), but they often lead to superfluous post-translational modifications, compromise normal folding, and severely impair the activity of POI. Here, “light-clothing” strategy, i.e., rationally trimming redundant parts of additive domains, is proposed. As visualized by green fluorescent protein as marker POI, this strategy avoids supernumerary post-translational modifications in F-POI synthesis, and enables its normal secretion and extraction. Applying epidermal growth factor as model functional POI, material fabrication versatility of the extracted mixture of F-POI and silk is demonstrated. This strategy increases structural similarity between F-POI and native POI and remarkably enhances F-POI activity to the same level as commercial POI, which facilitates applications of these advanced bio-synthesis platforms for developing high-performance materials.},

Here, high-performance pluronic F127 (P127)-modified gold shell (AuS)-polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR) is constructed. Under near-infrared irradiation, the resultant P127-AuS@CURs generate transient mild photothermia (TMP; ≈42 °C, 10 min), which facilitates their penetration through colonic mucus and favors multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieves intracellular oxidative stress, improves wound healing, and reduces immune responses by polarizing the proinflammatory M1-type macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2-type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel-encapsulating P127-AuS@CURs plus intestinal intralumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127-AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevates the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites can also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intralumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.},

Yet, there are a number of procedures during protein crystallization, including protein material production, purification, and crystal production, which take turns affecting the crystallization outcome. Due to the expensive and laborious nature of this multi-stage process, various computational tools have been developed to predict protein crystallization propensity, which is then used to guide the experimental determination. In this study, we presented a novel deep learning framework, PLMC, to improve multi-stage protein crystallization propensity prediction by leveraging a pre-trained protein language model. To effectively train PLMC, two groups of features of each protein were integrated into a more comprehensive representation, including protein language embeddings from the large-scale protein sequence database and a handcrafted feature set consisting of physicochemical, sequence-based and disordered-related information. These features were further separately embedded for refinement, and then concatenated for the final prediction. Notably, our extensive benchmarking tests demonstrate that PLMC greatly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by achieving AUC scores of 0.773, 0.893, and 0.913, respectively, at the aforementioned individual stages, and 0.982 at the final crystallization stage. Furthermore, PLMC is shown to be superior for predicting the crystallization of both globular and membrane proteins, as demonstrated by an AUC score of 0.991 for the latter. These results suggest the significant potential of PLMC in assisting researchers with the experimental design of crystallizable protein variants.},

Purely computational approaches hold distinct advantages over all other strategies in terms of the ease of implementation, time, speed, cost, and throughput, but they strongly underperform in terms of accuracy that significantly limits their application.

Here, we compared the accuracy of predictions of biologically relevant secondary structures of dozens of self-cleaving ribozyme sequences using 7 in silico RNA folding prediction tools with tasks of varying complexity. We found that while many programs performed well in relatively simple tasks, the performance varied significantly in more complex RNA folding problems.

   abstract = {Abstract Polyacrylic acid (PAA) and its derivatives are commonly used as essential matrices in wound dressings, but their weak wet adhesion restricts the clinical application. To address this issue, a PAA-based coacervate hydrogel with strong wet adhesion capability is fabricated through a facile mixture of PAA copolymers with isoprenyl oxy poly(ethylene glycol) ether and tannic acid (TA). The poly(ethylene glycol) segments on PAA prevent the electrostatic repulsion among the ionized carboxyl groups and absorbed TA to form coacervates. The absorbed TA provides solid adhesion to dry and wet substrates via multifarious interactions, which endows the coacervate with an adhesive strength to skin of 23.4 kPa and 70% adhesion underwater. This coacervate achieves desirable self-healing and extensible properties suitable for frequently moving joints. These investigations prove that the coacervate has strong antibacterial activity, facilitates fibroblast migration, and modulates M1/M2 polarization of macrophages. In vivo hemorrhage experiments further confirm that the coacervate dramatically shortens the hemostatic time from hundreds to tens of seconds. In addition, full-thickness skin defect experiments demonstrate that the coacervate achieves the best therapeutic effect by significantly promoting collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and epithelialization. These results demonstrate that a PAA-based coacervate hydrogel is a promising wound dressing for medical translation.},

   abstract = {Hydrocarbon pollution poses substantial environmental risks to water and soil. Bioremediation, which utilizes microorganisms to manage pollutants, offers a cost-effective solution. However, the role of viruses, particularly bacteriophages (phages), in bioremediation remains unexplored. This study examines the diversity and activity of hydrocarbon-degradation genes encoded by environmental viruses, focusing on phages, within public databases. We identified 57 high-quality phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) related to hydrocarbon degradation, which we refer to as virus-encoded hydrocarbon degradation genes (vHYDEGs). These genes are encoded by taxonomically diverse aquatic phages and highlight the under-characterized global virosphere. Six protein families involved in the initial alkane hydroxylation steps were identified. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the diverse evolutionary trajectories of vHYDEGs across habitats, revealing previously unknown biodegraders linked evolutionarily with vHYDEGs. Our findings suggest phage AMGs may contribute to alkane and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, participating in the initial, rate-limiting hydroxylation steps, thereby aiding hydrocarbon pollution bioremediation and promoting their propagation. To support future research, we developed vHyDeg, a database containing identified vHYDEGs with comprehensive annotations, facilitating the screening of hydrocarbon degradation AMGs and encouraging their bioremediation applications.},

   abstract = {Duck hepatitis A virus genotype 3 (DHAV-3) is the most popular pathogen of duck viral hepatitis (DVH) and has led to a huge economic threat to the Asian duck industry. In this work, we investigated the differences in the LC-MS/MS-based dynamic lipid profiles between susceptible and resistant Pekin duck lines with DHAV-3 infection. We found that the plasma lipidome of the two duck lines was characterized differently in expression levels of lipids during the infection, such as decreased levels of glycerolipids and increased levels of cholesteryl esters and glycerophospholipids in susceptible ducks compared with resistant ducks. By integrating lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis, we showed that the altered homeostasis of lipids was potentially regulated by a variety of differentially expressed genes including CHPT1, PI4K2A, and OSBP2 between the two duck lines, which could account for liver dysfunction, apoptosis, and illness upon DHAV-3 infection. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach, we determined a total of 25 infection-related lipids that were able to distinguish between the infection states of susceptible and resistant ducks. This study provides molecular clues for elucidating the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies of DHAV-3 infection in ducklings, which has implication for the development of resistance breeding.},

Conversely, edible plant-derived natural nanotherapeutics (NTs) are source-widespread and cost-effective, which have been shown remarkably effective in disease treatment. Herein, we extracted and purified exosome-like NTs from tea leaves (TLNTs), which had an average diameter of 166.9 nm and a negative-charged surface of − 28.8 mV. These TLNTs contained an adequate slew of functional components such as lipids, proteins and pharmacologically active molecules. In vitro studies indicated that TLNTs were effectively internalized by breast tumor cells (4T1 cells) and caused a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) after incubation for 8 h. The high levels of ROS triggered mitochondrial damages and arrested cell cycles, resulting in the apoptosis of tumor cells. The mouse experiments revealed that TLNTs achieved good therapeutic effects against breast tumors regardless of intravenous injection and oral administration through direct pro-apoptosis and microbiota modulation. Strikingly, the intravenous injection of TLNTs, not oral administration, yielded obvious hepatorenal toxicity and immune activation. These findings collectively demonstrate that TLNTs can be developed as a promising oral therapeutic platform for the treatment of breast cancer.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) with its rapidly increasing incidence has become an emerging challenge for public health. Therapeutic agents are required to be specifically delivered to colon epithelial cells and macrophages with controlled release in the cytoplasm for wound healing, inflammation alleviation, and microbiota rebalance. As a promising biomaterial for accomplishing this, Antheraea pernyi silk fibroin (ApSF) was selected and engineered to form nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with the anti-inflammatory drug, resveratrol (Res). The intrinsic features of these fabricated Res-ApNPs included targeting of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages, lysosomal escape capacity, and responsiveness to pH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione, which were pertinent to their functional units such as arginine-glycine-aspartate tripeptides, α-helixes, β-sheets, and disulfide bonds, enabling on-demand release of Res molecules in the cytoplasm of target cells. The Res-ApNP treatment restored damaged colonic epithelial barriers, polarized macrophages to type M2, alleviated inflammatory reactions, and reduced the level of intracellular ROS. Oral treatment with chitosan-alginate hydrogels embedded with Res-ApNPs substantially relieved UC symptoms, as evidenced by decreased colonic inflammation, increased synthesis of tight-junction proteins, and rebalanced intestinal microbiota. Our findings suggest that these high-performance ApSF-based NPs can be developed as effective drug carriers for oral UC treatment.},

   abstract = {<p>Early cancer detection is the key to a positive clinical outcome. While a number of early diagnostics methods exist in clinics today, they tend to be invasive and limited to a few cancer types. Thus, a clear need exists for non-invasive diagnostics methods that can be used to detect the presence of cancer of any type. Liquid biopsy based on analysis of molecular components of peripheral blood has shown significant promise in such pan-cancer diagnostics; however, existing methods based on this approach require improvements, especially in sensitivity of early-stage cancer detection. The improvement would likely require diagnostics assays based on multiple different types of biomarkers and, thus, calls for identification of novel types of cancer-related biomarkers that can be used in liquid biopsy. Whole-blood transcriptome, especially its non-coding component, represents an obvious yet under-explored biomarker for pan-cancer detection. In this study, we show that whole transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq could indeed serve as a viable biomarker for pan-cancer detection. Furthermore, a class of long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, very long intergenic non-coding (vlinc) RNAs, demonstrated superior performance compared with protein-coding mRNAs. Finally, we show that age and presence of non-blood cancers change transcriptome in similar, yet not identical, directions and explore implications of this observation for pan-cancer diagnostics.</p>},

This study is aimed at investigating the molecular basis of HL in an affected Chinese family and the genotype-phenotype correlation of WFS1 variants. Methods. The clinical phenotype of the five-generation Chinese family was characterized using audiological examinations and pedigree analysis. Target exome sequencing of 129 known deafness genes and bioinformatics analysis were performed among six patients and four normal subjects to screen suspected pathogenic variants. We built a complete WFS1 protein model to assess the potential effects of the variant on protein structure. Results. A novel heterozygous pathogenic variant NM_006005.3 c.2020G>T (p.Gly674Trp) was identified in the WFS1 gene, located in the C-terminal domain of the wolframin protein. We further showed that HL-related WFS1 missense variants were mainly concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) domain. In contrast, WS-related missense variants are randomly distributed throughout the protein. Conclusions. In this family, we identified a novel variant p.Gly674Trp of WFS1 as the primary pathogenic variant causing the low-frequency sensorineural HL, enriching the mutational spectrum of the WFS1 gene.},

@article{Qi2016eindex,
   abstract = {While it is a daunting challenge in current biology to understand how the underlying network of genes regulates complex dynamic traits, functional mapping, a tool for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), has been applied in a variety of cases to tackle this challenge. Though useful and powerful, functional mapping performs well only when one or more model parameters are clearly responsible for the developmental trajectory, typically being a logistic curve. Moreover, it does not work when the curves are more complex than that, especially when they are not monotonic. To overcome this inadaptability, we therefore propose a mathematical-biological concept and measurement, E-index (earliness-index), which cumulatively measures the earliness degree to which a variable (or a dynamic trait) increases or decreases its value. Theoretical proofs and simulation studies show that E-index is more general than functional mapping and can be applied to any complex dynamic traits, including those with logistic curves and those with nonmonotonic curves. Meanwhile, E-index vector is proposed as well to capture more subtle differences of developmental patterns.},

The lack of ground-truth labels and annotations in sequencing data presents a significant challenge for evaluating the efficacy of analytical tools. To address this, we developed Tresor, an integrated platform for simulating both short and long reads at bulk and single-cell levels. We devised a tree-based algorithm to significantly accelerate in silico experiments at high PCR cycles. Tresor allows for customising sequencing libraries with highly modular and flexible read structures, facilitating the verification of sequencing-related biological discoveries. This tool also includes features that introduce substitution, insertion, and deletion errors at various stages of library preparation, PCR amplification, and sequencing, enhancing its applicability in diverse experimental conditions and simulating real world conditions. Our results demonstrate that, upon removal of PCR duplicates, cell type-specific gene expression profiles derived from our simulated reads highly resemble reference data.

The use of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) in sequencing protocols has become a standard approach for distinguishing molecular identities. However, PCR artefacts and sequencing errors in UMIs present a significant challenge for effective UMI collapsing and accurate molecular counting. Current computational strategies for UMI collapsing often exhibit limited flexibility, providing invariable deduplicated counts that inadequately adapt to varying experimental conditions. To address these limitations, we developed mclUMI, a tool employing the Markov clustering algorithm to accurately identify original UMIs and eliminate PCR duplicates. Unlike conventional methods, mclUMI automates the detection of independent communities within UMI graphs by dynamically fine-tuning inflation and expansion parameters, enabling context-dependent merging of UMIs based on their connectivity patterns. Through in silico experiments, we demonstrate that mclUMI generates dynamically adaptable deduplication outcomes tailored to diverse experimental scenarios, particularly best-performing under high sequencing error rates. By integrating connectivity-driven clustering, mclUMI enhances the accuracy of molecular counting in noisy sequencing environments, addressing the rigidity of current UMI deduplication frameworks.Competing Interest StatementA.P.C is listed as an inventor on several patents filed by Oxford University Innovations concerning single-cell sequencing technologies.
